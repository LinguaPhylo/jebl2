This is the Java Evolutionary Biology Library project ("jebl")

A Java library for evolutionary biology and bioinformatics, including objects representing biomolecular sequences, multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees.

This is a branch of the original JEBL on http://sourceforge.net/projects/jebl/  to develop a new API and class library.
